  <p>A view of the different types of sand available in the US that are deemed to be safe for corydoras catfish.</p>

  <h3>CaribSea Super Naturals</h3>
  <p>This sand is <i>extremely</i> fine. It's practically a powder and when on the hand, it 'sticks'. There are no sharp
    edges and it does not feel grainy. It's an off-white color.</p>

  <h3>QuikCrete Play Sand</h3>
  <p>Also a very soft sand, very fine, sort of powdery. This one is very close in feel to the CaribSea, but is not as
    'sticky' on the hand.</p>
