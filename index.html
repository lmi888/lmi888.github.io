  <h1>Sand Comparison</h1>
  <p>A view of the different types of sand available in the US that are deemed to be safe for corydoras catfish.</p>

  <h3>CaribSea Super Naturals</h3>
  <p>This sand is <i>extremely</i> fine. It's practically a powder and when on the hand, it 'sticks'. There are no sharp
    edges and it does not feel grainy. It's an off-white color.</p>

  <h3>QuikCrete Play Sand</h3>
  <p>Also a very soft sand, very fine, sort of powdery. This one is very close in feel to the CaribSea, but is not as
    'sticky' on the hand.</p>

  <h3>Black Diamond Blasting Sand, Fine, 20/40</h3>
  <p>
    Very soft. Glittery. Very dusty. In the images below you can see it looks sharp. It's not. No damage to my hands,
    not even any pain when grinding it between my fingers. Because I'm crazy, I took a fingertip full and rubbed it on
    the inside of my lip. No pain, no cuts or even a raw feeling. This is the item purchased: <a

  <h3>Aqueon Shrimp and Plant Substrate</h3>
  <p>Feels very smooth. I found 1 that had a bit of the black coating coming off of it, but it was not easily peeled off
    and I could not crush the bead by hand. Very hard, but light weight. Kind of like 'buckshot'.</p>
